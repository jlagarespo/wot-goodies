Build the image with: docker build -t moonsheep/wotppbot .
Then just run it as a Docker container: docker run --env BOT_TOKEN="<your token goes here>" moonsheep/wotppbot
Note that you must replace <your token goes here> with your bot's token.

Special thanks to Ciaran for helping me figure this out.
